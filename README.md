# Local Setup

If running locally first install the node server required to avoid cors. (Can't make HTTP request to other URLs without using a backend)

1. run "git clone https://github.com/DevilxDude/livewebsitetrackingserver"
2. Run "npm install" on the server
3. Run "npm start" to run the server in the background

For the app the process is simple

1. run "git clone https://github.com/DevilxDude/livewebsitetracking.git"
2. Run "npm install"
3. With the node server running in the background just run "npm start"

# You can avoid the step if you are using the netlify build
